## Abstract

Insect-related disasters are one of the most important factors affecting crop yield due to the fast reproduction and widely distributed, 
large variety of insects. In the agricultural revolution, detecting and recognizing insects plays an important role in the ability for crops 
to grow healthily and produce a high-quality yield. To achieve this, insect recognition helps to differentiate between bugs that must be targeted 
for pest control and bugs that are essential for protecting farms. Machine learning, especially deep learning requires a large volume of data to 
achieve high performance. Therefore, we introduce a novel "Insect Foundation" dataset, a game-changing resource poised to revolutionize insect-related 
foundation model training. This rich and expansive dataset consists of 900,000 images with dense labels of taxonomy hierarchy from the high level 
of taxonomy (e.g., Class, Order) to the low level of taxonomy (e.g., Genus, Species). Covering a vast spectrum of insect species, our dataset offers 
a panoramic view of entomology, enabling foundation models to comprehend visual and semantic information about insects like never before. 
Our proposed dataset carries immense value, fostering breakthroughs across precision agriculture and entomology research. Insect Foundation Dataset 
promises to empower the next generation of insect-related AI models, bringing them closer to the ultimate goal of precision agriculture.
